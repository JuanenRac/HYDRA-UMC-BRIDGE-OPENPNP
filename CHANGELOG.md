# Changelog

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-30

- Made an unknown SDK job phase fail closed instead of only avoiding a
  `KeyError`: no unrecognized phase can now be marked as allowed for an
  OpenPnP board hand-off.
- Synchronized the English README and all six translated README files with
  the current version.
- Successful incremental build: synchronized package metadata and
  `hydra-umc.project.json`.

## [0.0.1]

- Added traceable PCB hand-off coordinator, SDK safety gate and local tests.
- Added non-mutating build-test scripts and CI SDK checkout.
- Standardized README (all 7 languages) and project banner to match the
  rest of the ecosystem's established-project structure.
- Fixed a latent crash risk: `BoardFlow.plan()` looked up a job's handoff
  label with a plain dict index, which would raise an unhandled
  `KeyError` for any `JobPhase` the shared SDK might add in the future
  without this bridge's own handoff table being updated in lockstep. Now
  falls back to a real `"unrecognized-phase"` label instead of crashing -
  verified with a new test that reproduces exactly that condition.
- Promoted to `established`: manifest, docs, build-test/CI and this
  project's own real functional gap (above) all verified locally.
