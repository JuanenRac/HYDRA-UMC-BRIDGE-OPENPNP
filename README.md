## 1. 🛠️ TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

**HYDRA-UMC-BRIDGE-OPENPNP** is the high-level board-flow bridge between HYDRA-UMC and OpenPnP. It coordinates PCB preparation, robot loading, native placement, robot unloading and traceable completion. It does not implement placement kinematics, feeder control or raw motion — those stay entirely inside OpenPnP.

It belongs to the **External Automation Bridges** family: a set of sibling repositories (CNC, LASER, OPENPNP, PRINTER3D, ROS2) that all speak the same shared safety contract from `HYDRA-UMC-SDK`, so no bridge can invent its own definition of "safe to work".

### Key Features:
* ✅ **Real traceable board-flow core:** `board_flow.py`'s `BoardFlow.plan()` rejects any job whose `board_id` is empty or has leading/trailing whitespace *before* even evaluating the safety gate — every hand-off is required to carry a stable, clean identifier. *(implemented, tested in `tests/test_board_flow.py`)*
* ✅ **Real per-phase hand-off map:** a fixed dictionary maps every `JobPhase` (`PREPARE`, `LOAD`, `PROCESS`, `UNLOAD`, `COMPLETE`, `ABORT`) to one explicit, human-readable hand-off description — `verify-board-and-fixture`, `robot-loads-board-into-pnp-fixture`, `openpnp-places-declared-job`, and so on. *(implemented)*
* ✅ **Real shared safety gate:** every valid job is evaluated through `evaluate_job()` from `HYDRA-UMC-SDK`'s `bridge_contract`, the same gate every sibling bridge and HYDRA-UMC-SERVER use; a productive hand-off only proceeds when the external machine reports `IDLE` and the HYDRA-UMC cell is `READY`. *(implemented)*
* ✅ **Non-mutating build/test:** `build-test.bat`/`.sh` compile the source and run the board-traceability and fail-safe test suite without touching version files or CHANGELOG. *(implemented, see BUILD & RUN below)*
* ✅ **Read-only OpenPnP profile inspection:** `inspect_openpnp_config.py` parses a saved `machine.xml`, while `openpnp-scripts/HYDRA-UMC/inspect_profile.js` is a manually invoked OpenPnP menu-script template; both report only class and component counts, and the template presents that result in an informational dialog without sending a machine command. *(implemented, tested)*
* ✅ **Trace-only hand-off simulation:** `BoardIdentity` binds board, recipe, revision and lot identifiers before `simulate_board_handoff()` applies the shared SDK gate; it emits a deterministic SHA-256 trace fingerprint only for an allowed plan and has no OpenPnP, serial or machine I/O. *(implemented, tested)*
* ✅ **Trace-only productive-cycle simulation:** `simulate_board_cycle()` evaluates the ordered `PREPARE → LOAD → PROCESS → UNLOAD → COMPLETE` sequence under one explicit cell/machine state; every productive step fails closed outside `READY/IDLE`, and `ABORT` remains separate in the SDK safety path. *(implemented, tested)*
* ✅ **Deterministic evidence contract:** `docs/HANDOFF_EVIDENCE.md` defines schema `1.0` emitted by both simulators. It carries only phase, decision, reason and a permitted identity fingerprint; raw board, recipe, revision and lot values never enter the JSON record. *(implemented, tested)*

## 3. 🧱 ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN DECISIONS

* **Why `board_id` validation happens before anything else in `plan()`.** `BoardFlow.plan()`'s very first check is `not board_id or board_id.strip() != board_id` — a malformed or ambiguous board identifier is rejected immediately, with an explicit reason, instead of being forwarded downstream where it would be harder to trace.
* **Why hand-offs are a fixed dictionary keyed by `JobPhase`, not string formatting.** `BoardFlow._handoffs` maps each of the six supported phases to one literal, unambiguous description. An unknown future phase is rejected with `unrecognized-phase`; it cannot become an allowed hand-off merely because the common SDK gate is otherwise ready.
* **Why the bridge only plans a productive transfer when the external machine is `IDLE` and the cell is `READY`.** Board hand-off is a two-sided physical operation; if either side is not in a known-safe state, planning a transfer would be asking a robot to move into an unpredictable machine.
* **Why `ABORT` can still be requested during a fault.** `JobPhase.ABORT` maps to `request-controlled-stop`, which the shared `evaluate_job()` gate does not block the same way it blocks productive phases — an operator or supervisor must always be able to ask for a controlled stop, even mid-fault.
* **Why the live OpenPnP extension/API is still deferred.** The saved machine profile can now be inspected read-only, but choosing a plugin interface or live surface still requires a non-production test session; that prevents this bridge from embedding unverified motion or feeder assumptions.
* **How this fits the rest of the ecosystem.** BRIDGE-OPENPNP sits between an OpenPnP job and `HYDRA-UMC-SDK` → `HYDRA-UMC-SERVER` → cell safety — it coordinates the robot side of a board hand-off, it never claims placement kinematics or feeder control that belong to OpenPnP itself.

## 4. ⚙️ BUILD & RUN

Requires Python 3.11+. `tools/build_test.py` expects `HYDRA-UMC-SDK` checked out as a sibling directory (`../HYDRA-UMC-SDK`) or pointed at via the `HYDRA_UMC_SDK_ROOT` environment variable.

```bash
# Windows
build-test.bat      # validate only — no version/CHANGELOG change
build.bat            # validate, then bump version + CHANGELOG on success

# Linux/macOS
bash build-test.sh
bash build.sh
```

`build-test` compiles every module under `src/` with `py_compile` and runs the full `unittest` suite (`tests/test_board_flow.py`), proving board-traceability rejection and fail-safe gating — it never modifies the repository. `build` runs that same validation first and, only on success, calls `tools/bump_version.py` to synchronize the version across `pyproject.toml`, `hydra-umc.project.json` and `CHANGELOG.md`. There is no live machine `run` command yet — that requires a validated OpenPnP integration.

---

## ✅ Current Status & Next Steps

**Real today:** version `0.1.0`, a locally tested traceable PCB hand-off core (`BoardFlow`) backed by `HYDRA-UMC-SDK`'s shared job gate, a deterministic twenty-eight-test `unittest` suite, a saved-profile inspector reporting real OpenPnP actuator/signaler/nozzle-tip evidence alongside head/camera/driver/feeder counts, a visible read-only OpenPnP menu-script template, identity-bound hand-off/cycle simulations, and a CI-verified non-sensitive JSON evidence contract with no machine I/O.

**Integration boundary:** OpenPnP retains placement kinematics, feeder control and raw motion at all times; this bridge only ever gates and traces the *hand-off* around it — robot loading, native placement completion, robot unloading.

**Still ahead:** no live machine connection is claimed — the concrete OpenPnP extension/API will be selected only in an isolated non-production session with an operator present.
